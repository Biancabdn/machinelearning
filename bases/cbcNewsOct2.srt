12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,933
  Hello, I'm Michael Serapio.

13
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:51,333
 Every year the monsoon rains
  arrive in Pakistan.

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,667
  But this year the rainfall
   was so heavy it triggered

15
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:58,400
  one of the biggest natural
catastrophes in living memory.

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:02,333
Sweeping in from the Arabian Sea
and the Bay of Bengal the rains

17
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:06,567
mixed with melting snow
   in the northern mountains
  to cause massive flooding.

00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,267
[people screaming]

19
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:11,133
   Michael: By early August
   dozens of roads, bridges

20
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:13,800
  and entire villages
 had been swept away.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,733
  More than a thousand people
were dead, two million
 people were homeless.

22
00:01:17,733 --> 00:01:21,667
  "It rained for three days,"
 he says. "Water kept rising.

23
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,800
 Many people drowned."

24
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,867
   And right from the start,
 relief organisations

25
00:01:26,867 --> 00:01:30,267
   knew that getting help to
  the needy wouldn't be easy.

26
00:01:30,267 --> 00:01:33,267
   The terrain, mountainous,

27
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:35,933
 hot, remote,

28
00:01:35,933 --> 00:01:39,267
   difficult access,
political instability,

29
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:42,667
 all of those
   make a dangerous potion.

30
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:45,800
   Michael: But as the rains
 kept falling,

31
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,533
  nobody could have predicted
  the scale of the disaster.

32
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:53,133
  The Pakistani army
   was quickly overwhelmed.

33
00:01:53,133 --> 00:02:01,167
  Many areas received no aid,
 and despair turned to anger.

34
00:02:01,167 --> 00:02:04,967
   own people, and the poorage
 get nothing," this man said.

35
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:08,367
 Michael: Meanwhile in Canada,
  Pakistani-Canadians

36
00:02:08,367 --> 00:02:11,467
were desperate for news
about their relatives.

37
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:14,700
 I feel bad and again
  I will say I feel helpless.

38
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:17,700
Michael: That sense of
helplessness only grew

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,233
  as water continued to surge
down Pakistan's longest river,
  the Indus.

40
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:24,933
The number of those affected by
 the flooding continued to grow.

41
00:02:24,933 --> 00:02:28,267
   And as the CBC's 
  Adrienne Arsenault reported

42
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,667
from the flood zone, so did the
threat of political instability.

43
00:02:31,667 --> 00:02:35,800
   The monsoon rains
aren't done with Pakistan yet.

44
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,467
In the northwest where flooding
  was supposed to be abating,

45
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:43,133
menacing skies wreck the army's
  still urgent relief effort.

46
00:02:43,133 --> 00:02:46,800
In the bellies of idle military
helicopters are enough supplies

47
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,033
  to feed hundreds of
  stranded people for a week,

48
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:53,067
  but there's no help
 coming today.

49
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:56,533
Do you think that means
they're in trouble?

50
00:02:56,533 --> 00:03:00,933
 They are in trouble.
   They're two weeks without
   anything to eat or drink.

51
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:04,900
   So we have help,
but we are unable to give them.

52
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:08,033
   For two days now,
  these Pakistani and Afghani

53
00:03:08,033 --> 00:03:11,167
 military helicopters
  that are loaded with relief

54
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,567
have been sitting here grounded
 because of the driving rain.

55
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:17,700
   That means two more days
that tens of thousands of people

56
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,833
   remain completely cut off
 from the most basic of help.

57
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,033
  In parts of the northwest,
  there is still some

58
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,367
precarious road access.
  Neither government workers

59
00:03:27,367 --> 00:03:30,567
 nor many aid agencies
 have made it through.

60
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:33,833
   Falah-e-Insaniat
has been here, though,

61
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:38,100
 a local charity with so many
connections, it was able to get

62
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,367
food aid and money out far and
fast, often on behalf of others.

63
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:46,167
 On the burst banks of
 the Kabul River, Rahim Khan,

64
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,667
 a teacher who saw the waters
   punch a hole in his home,

65
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:53,267
 say the government's
 weak response was a mistake.

66
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:53,400


67
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,067
  Adrienne: Falah-e-Insaniat
 was eager to tell us

68
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:05,600
 they step in
  where the government fails.

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,133
   "We're providing food and
 medical supplies, but
 there's also a long-term plan

70
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:14,333
  in which we're giving them
   money," said a spokesman.

71
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:17,333
 That phrase "long-term plan"
scares the Pakistani government.

72
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:21,000
 It worries there are
radical Islamist groups
who will use the floods

73
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,167
 as an opportunity to recruit,
  spread a militant message,
  and weaken the government.

74
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:28,600
  And Falah-e-Insaniat raises
  eyebrows here, often viewed

75
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,933
  as a rebranding of
Jamat ud Dawa, a banned

76
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:35,967
organisation linked to
   the militant group blamed
   for the Mumbai bombings.

77
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,900
Jamat ud Dawa's offices
 were closed last year
   and these people

78
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,600
 insist theirs is not just the
same old group with a new name.

79
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,600
You're not a banned
organisation?
 No, no, no.

80
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,733
   Adrienne: But as we were
 leaving, the group spokesman

81
00:04:49,733 --> 00:04:53,000
passed me his card. It clearly
  links him to Jamat ud Dawa.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,267
The connexion is hardly hidden.
On the ground, though,

83
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:59,200
neither Rahim Khan nor
  the others in line for help

84
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,300
 from Falah-e-Insaniat
gave the possible link
  a moment's thought.

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:02,433


86
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,067
Adrienne: He doesn't care about
  political motives, he says.

87
00:05:14,067 --> 00:05:17,733
 He knows these people simply
  as the ones who showed up.

88
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:20,400
 Adrienne Arsenault, CBC News,

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,600
   Nowshera in north-western
   Pakistan.

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,933
As the scale of the humanitarian
 catastrophe continued to grow

91
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:30,067
   another problem emerged.
   Despite the pressing need

92
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:33,333
for emergency aid, many
  countries including Canada,

93
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,233
 were slow to respond. And as
the CBC's Briar Stewart reports,

94
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:40,633
that had some Canadians
wondering why.

95
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,633
   At this family-run store,

96
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:46,400
   the disaster in Pakistan
is a constant concern.

97
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,067
 Nadia Ahmad's father
 is there visiting relatives,

98
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:53,833
and he's had to travel through
 the flood zone to reach them.

99
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:56,967
He said a lot of children were
buried, just within the ground,

100
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:59,267
 and they just drowned
   and nobody knows.

101
00:05:59,267 --> 00:06:02,067
Briar: Ahmad remembers
 how her neighbourhood

102
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,433
  raised money after
 the tsunami in 2004.

103
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:06,700
She says this disaster

104
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,067
 doesn't seem to be generating
   as urgent of a response.

105
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,133
I think it's really sad. Perhaps
 there's a lack of awareness.

106
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:16,200
   Briar: Pakistan appealed
 for aid two days ago.

107
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,200
The Canadian government
  pledged $2 million,

108
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,867
  an amount many feel
 is too small.

109
00:06:21,867 --> 00:06:25,200
 The minister of international
   cooperation says Canada's

110
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,333
 contribution may seem small,

111
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:30,600
  but there are expectations
 more will be coming.

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,067
  The government insists the
relief effort must be controlled

113
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:37,467
and points to previous disasters
where aid sat for days

114
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,567
   waiting to be delivered,
   but many agencies

115
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:43,800
 working on the ground
   don't buy that argument.

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,067
It's almost 10 days now
 that this started, you know.

117
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:49,733
Like, I find the excuse
  a little bit weak.

118
00:06:49,733 --> 00:06:53,200
   Briar: And the public has
  also been slow to respond.

119
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,333
Agencies are concerned
   it could be due to fears

120
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,667
  that the money might end up
  in the hands of insurgents.

121
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,400
The floods is everywhere, it's
 the whole country, you know,

122
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,833
 from north to south.
   So the Taliban don't have

123
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:10,400
  a presence there, you know,
  and they are a small group.

124
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,967
Briar: A reality Ahmad
   hopes people understand.

125
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:17,100
This is sad when people
   bring up politics
  because it's a human being.

126
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,967
Briar: And right now, the United
   Nations says in Pakistan,

127
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:24,700
 there are six million of them
  in immediate need of help.

128
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,067
Briar Stewart,
   CBC News, Toronto.

129
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:31,600
 Michael: Those numbers would
 only grow, and by mid August

130
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,267
 the U.N.'s Secretary General
   declared the catastrophe

131
00:07:35,267 --> 00:07:38,333
 in Pakistan the worst
   he had ever seen.

132
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:42,667
  I have had a chance to see
  the tremendous destruction

133
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:46,600
and profound suffering
   with my own eyes.

134
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,833
It is heart-wrenching.
The scale and magnitude

135
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:55,167
  is difficult to comprehend,
  beyond imagination.

136
00:07:55,167 --> 00:07:59,300
 Michael: Ban Ki-Moon
 pleaded with other countries
 to step up their aid efforts.

137
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,367
   But as the CBC's 
 Adrienne Arsenault reported,

138
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,100
   even getting limited help
   to the needy wasn't easy.

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:10,433
 The Pakistani army is always
   in a hurry now in Punjab

140
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:14,833
taking dozens of relief flights
daily over still flooded land.

141
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,633
A swath the size of the United
 Kingdom looks like this now,

142
00:08:18,633 --> 00:08:22,200
  a vast, muddy lake
with small patches of dry land.

143
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,867
   Even those trying to flee
  might not know where to go.

144
00:08:25,867 --> 00:08:29,533
 The Pakistani army says it is
always ready to conduct rescues

145
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:32,800
 as well as offering aid, but
 it's encountering a problem:

146
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,133
 many flood survivors
are too scared to leave
 their flooding homes.

147
00:08:36,133 --> 00:08:39,533
 They've already lost
their crops so the last
thing they want to do is leave

148
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:42,400
 their very last possessions.
So they're saying, no.

149
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,267
   This is extremely
 frustrating for the rescuers

150
00:08:45,267 --> 00:08:48,200
because they know those people
   are risking their lives.

151
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,000
   Carrying water and milk,
  enough for just a few days,

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,833
they land at a camp in Jampur.
 Eight hundred people,

153
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,633
barely a hundred tents.
   Many say they were chased

154
00:08:59,633 --> 00:09:03,967
by the water, fled to one place
 only to be flooded out again.

155
00:09:03,967 --> 00:09:07,900
   Others immediately sought
  high ground, climbed trees

156
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,700
 only to find snakes,
  cobras have done the same.

157
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,633
 On a bed in the heat,
   Razia, who says she broke
   her back in three places

158
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:19,300
   when she fell off a roof
  trying to escape the water.

159
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,633
   [through Interpreter]

160
00:09:21,633 --> 00:09:25,500
She's saying she's suffering
a lot over here.

161
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,733
That's why she needs evacuation.

162
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:32,667
  Adrienne: He says she's had
  a basic operation, will be

163
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:36,533
 evacuated properly to a good
 hospital soon but not today.

164
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:40,000
  Remarkably,
  the military say those here

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
   are still in better shape
  than the stubborn stranded.

166
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,533
I requested them, even
 I placed my hands like this,

167
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:49,200
  "Please come with me, come
with me," but they don't come.

168
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,467
 They say, "We want to
 protect our luggage."

169
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:54,000
Adrienne: So routinely

170
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,100
they drop them water and food.

171
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,733
  Ten minutes on the ground,
  that's it, and they leave.

172
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,700
There are more to worry about.

173
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,367
 Flying out, the army
  carries pharmacists

174
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:09,833
  who are now moving
  on to other camps.

175
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:13,967
There are many cases of
snake bites and malaria problem

176
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:17,300
there and diarrhoea
and skin rashes.

177
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:21,433
Skin problems and digestive
problems are mostly seen there.

178
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,300
   Adrienne: Do you have
 the anti-venom for the snake
 bites?

179
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:28,367
Actually, ma'am, anti-venom,
  it is very costly.

180
00:10:28,367 --> 00:10:32,300
Adrienne: Back on base
  and medicine is still key.

181
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,533
Rescued and ill kids usually end
up nearby at Multan's children's

182
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:39,533
 hospital in cramped,
  loud wards.

183
00:10:39,533 --> 00:10:41,400
[pained crying]

184
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,933
 Many must be treated outside.

185
00:10:43,933 --> 00:10:47,067
 This is dehydration,
 potentially fatal diarrhoea.

186
00:10:47,067 --> 00:10:50,467
Their mothers, with nowhere else
to stay, will sit here for days,

187
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:52,400
  and they too are often up.

188
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,400
 While Sakhina talks,

189
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,067
 her family, lying beside her,
  seems suddenly overwhelmed,

190
00:10:59,067 --> 00:11:02,800
  her sister-in-law actually
on the cellphone to her husband.

191
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,600
He stayed near the flooded home.

192
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,733
 He is stuck on an embankment
 surrounded by water.

193
00:11:08,733 --> 00:11:12,867
  "Men have been left behind
 and they're worried,"
   Sakhina explains.

194
00:11:12,867 --> 00:11:15,800
 "We can't go to them.
They can't come to us."

195
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,800
 So here's how
 this crisis spirals.

196
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
  Families separated,
  some getting help,

197
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,200
  but soon to return
  to grim temporary shelters

198
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,667
  where doctors fear
 they'll just get sick again.

199
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:32,100
  Adrienne Arsenault,
  CBC News, Multan, Pakistan.

200
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,500
 Michael: By September
  more than 20 million people

201
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,833
had been affected by the floods.
And with food, shelter,

202
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:43,267
and medicine all in short supply
  taking care of the youngest

203
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:46,633
   victims and their mothers
   became a major priority.

204
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:51,300
  Many women give their birth
  while they are travelling.

205
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,700
We are giving them the relief,
  whatever resources we have.

206
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,367
   Michael: But more aid was
arriving in the stricken areas,

207
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:01,833
   and the CBC's Nahlah Ayed

208
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,300
found one Canadian team
 trying to make a difference.

209
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:09,700
This boy was so sick, his mother
  worried he wouldn't make it
  through the night,

210
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,800
  but a few hours in hospital
  and he's ready to go home.

211
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,033
 They were displaced when the
rain swept their straw hut away.

212
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:22,567
 Since then, three of
  her children have suffered
severe vomiting and diarrhoea.

213
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:25,833
 "They helped me a lot here,"
   she says.

214
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:29,233
"I know they came from abroad,
but I don't know which country."

215
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:32,067
   She's never even
   heard of Canada.

216
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:35,733
But it was a tight team
of Canadian aid workers

217
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:39,733
 who turned a stretch of road
 into a small field hospital.

218
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:42,667
   What they've accomplished
  in just days speaks

219
00:12:42,667 --> 00:12:45,600
   to the possibilities here
if the will were there.

220
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,000
  Patients that we're seeing
with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea

221
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,300
symptoms easily cured.

222
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,267
We're trying to do as much as we
can to save as many as we can.

223
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:57,667
  Some were literally
   on death's door.

224
00:12:57,667 --> 00:13:00,533
Without treatment, left alone,
those people would die.

225
00:13:00,533 --> 00:13:03,200
  But what hospitals
  can't do alone is stop the

226
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,533
spread of disease, not without
  addressing the root causes.

227
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:10,400
How clean is this water?
  Very clean, we can
 drink it ourselves.

228
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,667
  Nahlah: At the core
 of their work

229
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,933
  is providing access
to clean water.

230
00:13:16,933 --> 00:13:19,600
  An hour away, Global Medic
 treats water in bulk.

231
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,433
   Each litre of clean water
 costs less than half a penny.

232
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:26,567
The stuff that they're drinking
 now, no wonder we're getting

233
00:13:26,567 --> 00:13:29,567
 cholera and outbreaks
  of watery diarrhoea, right.

234
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,767
 This is the solution. These 
 systems deliver clean water.

235
00:13:32,767 --> 00:13:35,933
 This is the only thing that's
  going to save this crisis.

236
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:39,400
 Nahlah: The water is shipped
to the camps directly.

237
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,767
  Once there,
   it quickly draws a crowd.

238
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:45,167
"This is the first time

239
00:13:45,167 --> 00:13:48,033
 we've received clean water,"
   he says.

240
00:13:48,033 --> 00:13:50,967
There's more the world
   and Canada can do

241
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:54,100
 to prevent the spread
of disease, says Singh.

242
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,333
  We don't understand
enough about Pakistan.
 We don't interact with them.

243
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,733
We have to understand the people
that are affected here, they're

244
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,400
   not the rich, they're not
 anti-Western people.

245
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,833
They're the poorest of the poor.
They really, really need help.

246
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,700
 Nahlah: They may not
   know Canada, but they are
grateful all the same.

247
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:15,367
Nahlah Ayed, CBC News, 
 Shikarpur, Pakistan.

248
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:19,033
  Michael: By late September
   the flood waters finally

249
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:22,500
began to recede. But vast areas
  remained submerged.

250
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,433
And with fields still flooded,
and homes, schools and hospitals

251
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:30,100
 destroyed, millions of people
   still have nowhere to go.

252
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,033
  The floods are estimated to
 have caused about $47 billion

253
00:14:34,033 --> 00:14:37,900
   in damage, a huge sum for
a country as poor as Pakistan.

254
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,700
 And experts continue to warn
   that unless more is done

255
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,567
to help, political instability
  can only make things worse.

256
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:47,633
  And that is News In Review.
